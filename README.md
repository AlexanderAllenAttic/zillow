Hi Richard,

Thanks for speaking with Edgar! He really enjoyed getting to know you. We would like for you to move onto the next step and complete the technical exercise below. If you have any questions please let me know. There is not a deadline, take your time and do your best. Thanks! 

1. Write a script to determine the machine’s local IPV4 address, locate all files with the extension “cfg” in /mnt/configFiles/, and replace all occurrences of “zillow.com” with that IP, and change the extension of each file to .conf.

2. Write a script that checks a website to ensure the text 'Powered by Whisky, Bikes, Coffee and Doughnuts.' is included in the response from http://streeteasy.com/ and sends an email if it does not. Explain the procedure for installing the script.

 

Thank you, 

Caitlin Stangland
